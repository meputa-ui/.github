# Meputa UI

> **Enterprise-grade UI built to ship features, with zero design bloat.**

## 🎯 Motive

**Meputa** — from the Igbo word *"to bring out" or "to produce"* — exists to help teams **bring out their product ideas faster**, with styled components that get out of the way. We believe UI libraries should accelerate development, not slow it down with unnecessary decisions or bloat.


## 💡 Inspiration & Motivation

Meputa is inspired by the **engineering completeness of Ant Design** and the **styling freedom of Tailwind CSS**. Like `shadcn/ui`, it embraces a developer-first approach — but with the added structure and polish needed for **enterprise-grade scalability**.

Our motivation is simple:
Developers should spend time on **features**, not **fighting design systems**.


## 🧠 Philosophy

* 🧱 **Pre-styled, but not opinionated** — components work out of the box, but are easy to tailor
* 🚀 **Rapid shipping matters** — UI shouldn't be a bottleneck for product delivery
* 🧩 **Consistency at scale** — apps should look and feel unified without extra effort
* 🌍 **Culturally rooted, globally useful** — named in Igbo, built for worldwide dev teams


## 🤝 Contribution

We welcome contributors who believe in building **fast, maintainable, and flexible UI systems**.

* Open a PR for improvements or new components
* Help document or extend the design tokens
* Share feedback on component ergonomics and usage

> Contribution guidelines coming soon.


## 🪄 Ease of Use

Using Meputa is as simple as:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@meputa/ui';

<Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
```

* Use any Tailwind class directly
* Focus on building — not theming from scratch
